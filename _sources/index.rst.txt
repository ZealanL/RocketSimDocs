Getting Started
---------------

Here's a basic example of creating an Arena, adding a Car, and simulating with custom inputs:

.. code-block::

		#include "./RocketSim/src/Sim/Arena/Arena.h"

		// Make an arena instance (this is where our simulation takes place, has its own btDynamicsWorld instance)
		Arena* arena = Arena::Create(GameMode::SOCCAR);
		
		// Make a new car
		// NOTE: The ball and all cars are freed from memory when their arena is deconstructed, you don't need to do it yourself
		Car* car = arena->AddCar(Team::BLUE);
		
		// Set up an initial state for our car
		CarState carState = {};
		carState.pos = { 0.f, 0.f, 17.f };
		carState.vel = { 50.f, 0.f, 0.f };
		car->SetState(carState);
		
		// Setup a ball state
		BallState ballState = {};
		ballState.pos = { 0.f, 400.f, 100.f };
		arena->ball->SetState(ballState);
		
		// Make our car drive forward and turn
		car->controls.throttle = 1;
		car->controls.steer = 1;
		
		// Simulate for 100 ticks
		arena->Step(100);
		
		// Lets see where our car went!
		std::cout << "After " << arena->tickCount << "ticks, our car is at: " << car->GetState().pos << std::endl;
		
		// Destroy the arena once we are done
		delete arena;
